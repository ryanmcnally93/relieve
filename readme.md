# Relieve | Re-Live

Relieve is a company based in Lichfield, Staffordshire that aspires to help the everyday person know more about mindfulness and meditation through its site information and available classes.

I have used markdown format for the headers and bullets, links and tables on this readme, but found the img element to be more useful when controlling picture sizes on this document.

## UX

### Project Goal

To improve the average person's knowledge of mindfulness and meditation, and the positive impact it can potentially have on their mental health.

#### Patient Goals

Many people wouldn’t feel comfortable being able to go to therapy sessions, whether in groups or one-to-one, phobias are diverse and complicated, and people can fear anything. Other people know someone who is struggling but have no idea how to help. For those people, the page describing how to overcome a panic attack would be extremely beneficial, and the sessions could be something they work up to.

- Calming spacious UX
- Empowering images
- Images of a fun class environment
- Information on why they feel this way
- Self help tips

#### Carer Goals

Any friend or relative of a sufferer can be considered a carer. They, at times, have a harder time than the sufferer as they are the one that is depended on.

- Information on classes location and times
- Information on how to stop a panic attack

#### Developer and Business Goals

We are passionate in the belief that all people should have access to these lessons and this network. It’s not just a lesson that you take part in and walk away, it’s a community of people looking out for each other.

There are a vast amount of people right now struggling with bad mental health. This means a lot of people could potentially use this meaning a lot of custom.

Maybe the company could invest time into doing school presentations, to create brand awareness as well as help young people understand mental health better, as it's often young people who struggle.

- Promotes inclusion
- Brings together a community
- Life saving advice and information
- Keeps people intrigued through regular newsletters
- Ensures the user either signs up to a newsletter, or attends a class

### User Stories

As someone who struggles with anxiety, I want:
- Calming, spacious UX that isn't cluttered and therefore stressful
- Peace inducing colours to subconsciously add to the sites serenity.
- To learn a bit about why I feel the way I feel and how to get better
- To know where my classes are and how to get there, so I feel safe

As someone who struggles with depression, I want:
- To know that I'm not alone, through images and tutor information
- To be ensured that people gain happiness from the classes
- Something that regularly makes me feel good as opposed to a one-time fix, something that stays with me for longer

As a relative or friend of someone who struggles, I want:
- To know where classes are and what times they are
- To know that my friend/relative is going to have an educational but fun experience
- To learn a bit myself so I can be of better help to my friend/relative


### Design Choices

The overall experience needs to feel calm, uncluttered and peaceful.

#### Fonts

- The primary font "Exo" was chosen because it has a nice rounded edge to the lettering, there is nothing sharp that sticks out, adding to the calm feel.
- The secondary font chosen is sans serif.


<img src="assets/images/readme-images/font.png" width="40%" alt="Exo Font" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

#### Icons

- All icons chosen are to describe the paragraph of text next to them, some have been taken out once viewed on a phone to help create space for the reading of the text.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/icons.png" width="40%" alt="Icons" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

#### Colours

- As we all know, different colours produce different moods. Red and yellow are usually avoided as they are very sharp and sometimes even angry colours when used the wrong way. Often you'll see professional looking greys and safe shades of blue on wedsites, but I've opted for shades of turquoise and green.

- Green is often seen as a peaceful, calm colour and I've mixed it with the professional blues.

- The only real exception to this is on the benefits page, where there is the warm orange/brown background image of the jogger.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/colours.png" width="40%" alt="Colour" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

#### Styling

- Divs have been given rounded edges to again add to that calming feeling, we don't want sharp and aggressive.
- This edging and spacing between divs and sections has been made consistent throughout the pages and content.

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/curves.png" width="40%" alt="Curved corners" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/margins.png" width="40%" alt="Margin spacing" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

#### Backgrounds

- Either hero images relevant to the page have been shown, white, or off-white (#FAFAFA) have been used.
- This is so that the site is not too distracting from the content and not add to stress levels of the viewer.

<img src="assets/images/signup-hero.jpeg" width="60%" alt="Hero image" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

#### Images

- The first image is a positive meditation one, almost putting the user directly into the class.
- The Sign Up page image is an adventurous one, which represents the user moving forward with their life or doing something "out there". It also adds a sense of freedom.
- The images of the tutors give familiarity to the user, and are positive smiling images, which could help them feel more comfortable.

- "A change to make to the website would be maybe including an alternative display option for example a dark screen alternative for people with colour blindness or an Audio Description choice for visually impared so that when you hover over an icon it says out loud what you are about to click."

### Competitor Review

Who else is there local to Lichfield, Staffordshire with similar business goals/models?

[Tarakmc](https://tarakmc.org/branch-classes/)

Pros:
They are a charity with a lot of background information, and ties to Buddhism, so you know you’re learning meditation properly.

Cons:
Way too much information on the website. Way too many places to click to, too much on each page. Writing is small. Photo gallery images are not relevant, no images of the sessions themselves just of a building and a staircase? Donations link doesn’t open donations page.

[The Bright Path](https://thebrightpath.co.uk/meditation-classes-Lichfield/)

Pros:
Really positive videos with music to match. Brilliant content. Responsive design is very good. Lots of helpful content and it looks like they have an intriguing course, a great product.

Cons
Too much written again, a bit too much information on each page. If you click on find a class, it opens a different site under the same URL? The structure of the site is very confusing, the Navbar changes and it makes you feel like you’re using a different site. Once you open FAQ first thing you notice is a change in text size and spacing, webpages are supposed to be consistent.

### Roadmap

This roadmap indicates the importance and viability of specific opportunities.

| Opportunities/Problems      | Importance | Viability   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Teach users how to stop a panic attack      | 5       | 4
| Encourage them to sign uo to newsletter   | 4        | 5
| Encourage them to interact with classes   | 5        | 4
| Showcase images from classes   | 1        | 1
| Show them positive feedback from other users   | 4        | 1

As mentioned before, the stories page isn't necessary just yet as we don't have previous users feedback to use yet. So that and images from classes aren't necessary yet.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The main navigation bar uses the websites main colour in different shades from left to right to signal different pages and look more stylish.
  - It is responsive, it condenses into a burger icon as the webpage is made smaller for tablets and phone devices.
  - The Navbar also responds by changing background and text colour as the user hovers over each page option.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/navigation-bar.png" width="80%" alt="The navigation bar" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Footer__

  - The footer includes links to the websites main social media links, I have included the most commonly used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram whilst also including TikTok, as this site could promote short promotional videos of meditation on there.

  - I have also provided information about where the business is based, this will help with the SEO of the website, as people who live in Lichfield, Staffordshire are more likely to find this page.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/footer.png" width="80%" alt="The footer" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Logo__

  - The idea for the logo was to make the middle "e" a different colour son that it could be read in two different ways. Relieve and Re-Live.
  - Since the company is focused on empowering people, it made sense to include the idea of restarting your life with a clean slate or, re-living.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/logo.png" width="40%" alt="The logo" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __The landing page hero image__

  - I wanted an image that was both happy and focused on meditation, the one I have found I think is brilliant because there is also a pregnant woman in the background, which represents inclusion.

<img src="assets/images/index-hero.jpeg" width="75%" alt="Meditation group" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Who we are section__

  - This section is a brief overview of the whole site, once the user views this they have more knowledge of what this site is to be used for.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/who-we-are.png" width="60%" alt="The Who We Are Section" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Benefits__

  - The hero image of this website is a jogger, a perfect example of someone with good health. Here I wanted an inspiring, motivational image that also had very different colours and gave the page a warm comfortable feeling.

<img src="assets/images/benefits-hero.jpg" width="75%" alt="Jogger" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Statistic Progress Bars__

  - I wanted to use a visionary example for people visiting the page for the first time, rather than just reading lots of paragraphs. I thought I'd start with the higher number statistics, which really nail down the importance of good mental health.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/progress-bars.png" width="40%" alt="Progress bars" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Benefits Section__

  - I also wanted to add a section that was big, bold, and again nailed some of the important positives attached with learning how to meditate and be mindful.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/benefits-section.png" width="40%" alt="The Benefits Section" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Panic Attack Help Section__

  - I have the personal experience of panic attacks, and know just how important this information regarding panic attacks is. This being free, and visible on our site almost as an added on feature, showcases one of the powerful ways in which meditation and mindfulness can be used in a worrying situation/scenario and what it can achieve.
  - If someone doesn't feel comfortable coming to the sessions, they can take this information away and use it. Then at a later date when they have more confidence in the process, they will be more likely to make contact.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/panic.png" width="75%" alt="The Panic Section" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Classes__

  - This is the whole point of visiting the site. To let the users know when and where they can attend a session and find help. The classes give opportunity for people to meet other people face-to-face and share stories, meaning that there is a positive productive social circle.

- __Class Boxes__

- Here I've used two different images, which show up dependant on the size of the device being used. One is vertical, the other horizontal. I've contained the six classes available in a 3x3 grid, which changes to a 2x4 grid on smaller screens. Information included is the venue, tutor, time and date.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/classes-section.png" width="75%" alt="The classes available" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/classes-section-2.png" width="40%" alt="Smaller screen classes available" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __IFrames__

  - When I first encountered IFrames I knew I wanted to implement them on this site. They're perfect for people wanting to explore the surrounding area of where they're going to. People can decide which driving route to take and better plan their journey, or simply look for its position in correlation with other places they know.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/iframe.png" width="40%" alt="IFrame" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Tutor Information__

  - I tried to find images that looked professional, but also friendly, with people smiling. I didn't want any users to feel scared, instead, more welcome.
  - I also included some information regarding the people teaching the sessions, whilst also adding a bit of info about the class itself.
  - The IFrame, image of the tutors, and information have been palced within a grid. This grid is then responsive dependant on screen size being used and displays so that you can visibly see all the information you need to.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/tutor-section.png" width="60%" alt="IFrames and Tutors" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Sign Up Page__

  - The Sign Up page is for anyone who wants to receive the weekly newsletter will contain advice and information whilst also kindly reminding members of the classes available.
  - The form itself is made up of 3 fields, first name, last name and email. All have the required attribute meaning you cannot submit without the information required.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/signup-page.png" width="75%" alt="The sign up page" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

### Features Left to Implement

- __Stories Section__

  - Initially, I intended to have a stories page on the site, which would include stories from people who have used the service whilst in a position of anxiety or depression, and how their journey was.

  - As this business is just starting, it doesn't make sense to implement this page just yet, we could encourage users to share their stories which would empower them, and give them a sense of accomplishment, whilst also letting future users know that this is a process they can trust.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/stories-wireframe.png" width="40%" alt="What would have been the stories page" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- __Unhelpful thinking section__

    We could implement a page on unhelpful thinking habits. This could include black and white thinking and generalizations, to help the user see what they are doing day-to-day in their head and why it is unhelpful.

- __Classes Backend__

    Another feature that could be added is a sessions backend with a calendar so people can book themselves in for future sessions. They would be able to click on one of the six divs and choose a date with a session that had enough space available for another student.

- __Logging in and leaving reviews__

    Another development idea would be to allow users to log into the website and leave comments on the stories page or reviews of their sessions and tutors. This would be great for new users coming onto the site for the first time. And could be a great way to interact with customers whether they've had a good or bad experience.

- __Classes Gallery__

    We could also add images and videos from previous classes on either our classes, stories or even home webpage, eventually creating a gallery for new, current and/or previous users to look at.

## Testing 

First, I've opened the site using developer tools on the IPhone 5/SE emulator. I've chosen this as it is the smallest screen size available. The first most noticeable thing is when the pages are shown on screens below 800, it doesn't work to have margins of 20px, instead 10px is better, to make more use of the scree space available. Also I noticed that the px-5 bootstrap calling was adding way too much padding to the who we are section, so I've changed this to px-4 which seems to be a lot better suited.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/home-iphone.png" width="30%" alt="Homepage on a IPhone" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The benefits page seems to work fine, the height change in the progress bar is working as intended, allowing for the text to fall to the next line without disturbing the bars shape.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/benefits-iphone.png" width="30%" alt="Benefits page on IPhone" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On the classes page, I noticed one issue. The bottom of the sessions section was cut off as the hero outer element had a height restriction. I had called for the height to change on smaller screens to about 1000px, but needed to change this to 1100px in order to see everything on this screen. After this change, the whole page was perfect, with margins at 10px, same as the other pages.

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/sessions-issue.png" width="40%" alt="Issue on sessions screen" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/sessions-fixed.png" width="40%" alt="Fixed sessions section" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/classes-iphone.png" width="30%" alt="Classes page on IPhone" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Thankfully the sign up page doesn't have too much information on it, the form is visible and again the spacing is good too.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/signup-iphone.png" width="30%" alt="Sign up page on IPhone" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Next, I've opened the site the same way on the IPad emulator. I've chosen this as it is a good middle sized screen between desktop and mobile. The burger icon is still in use on this webpage as without it the page links with the logo would be too wide for the screen. It opens, and the options are clickable and working. The margin of 10px is still being used as this isn't too large of a screen so we still want to make best use of the page. The slightly larger 800-1000px width tablets will have 20px margins.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/home-ipad.png" width="40%" alt="Homepage on IPad" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The benefits page also looks good so far. The progress bars now have less height as they no longer need it, and the images come into focus on the panic section, which looked very presentable and readable.

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/benefits-ipad.png" width="40%" alt="Progress bars on IPad" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/panic-ipad.png" width="40%" alt="Panic section on IPad" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

Everything is as it should be now on the classes page too, margin is the same as the benefits page and the grid has not yet changed.

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/sessions-ipad.png" width="40%" alt="Sessions section on IPad" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/tutor-ipad.png" width="40%" alt="Tutor section on IPad" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

This is the grid layout on the slightly larger screens, like the Surface Pro 7:

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/tutor-surface7.png" width="30%" alt="Tutor section between 800-1000px width screens" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The sign up page looks as good as it did on the smallest screen.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/signup-ipad.png" width="40%" alt="Sign up page on IPad" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Last, I've opened the website on my normal desktop screen. The homepage looks as it should:

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/home-desktop.png" width="40%" alt="Homepage on a large device" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The benefits page also looks good on desktop screens.

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/benefits-desktop-1.png" width="40%" alt="Benefits page on a large device" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/benefits-desktop-2.png" width="40%" alt="Benefits page on a large device" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

The layout of the grid has changed again for the tutors section on desktop screens, but the 20px margin remains. The image has also changed for the sessions background.

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/classes-desktop-1.png" width="40%" alt="Classes page on a large device" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/classes-desktop-2.png" width="40%" alt="Classes page on a large device" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

The sign up page looks as it should.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/signup-desktop.png" width="40%" alt="Sign up page on a large device" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The following section is the testing of each element.

The first image is of the homepage on a larger screen, we can see that the cover text box is on the right. But when we look at the second image with is slightly larger than 600 pixels wide, the cover box has now been centered. On the last image, which is under 600 pixels, you can see that the image is different in its placement. I cropped the original image and called this on smaller screens so when viewed on mobile, the main woman is still visible, as opposed to seeing the blank space between people and not knowing what the image was originally.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/homepage-big.png" width="40%" alt="Homepage on a large device" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

But when we look at this second image, which is slightly larger than 600 pixels wide, the cover box has now been centered. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/homepage-med.png" width="20%" alt="Homepage on a medium sixed device" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On the last image, which is under 600 pixels, you can see that the image is different in its placement. I cropped the original image and called this on smaller screens so when viewed on the minimum width of 320 pixels wide, the main woman is still visible, as opposed to seeing the blank space between people and not knowing what the image was originally.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/homepage-small.png" width="20%" alt="Homepage on a small device" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The Navbar buttons change as required when hovered over, the background colour changes to the darker shade and the text colour changes to a lighter shade so the user knows they have scrolled over a clickable link.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/link-before.png" width="80%" alt="Link before hover" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

This is the case throughout the site on clickable buttons, like the one in the cover text box and submit button on the sign-up form.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/link-after.png" width="80%" alt="Link after hover" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The only slightly different one is the logo, the word "relieve" is deliberately broken up into the phrase "re-live". 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/logo-before.png" width="50%" alt="Logo before hover" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Until you hover over it and all the letters are the same colour.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/logo-after.png" width="50%" alt="Logo after hover" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

I've added a size change to the logo that works perfectly. This is it before the change.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/logo-big-text.png" width="60%" alt="Logo on big screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

And this is it after, on the smallest screen width of 320 pixels. You'll notice that this now means the burger icon is on the same line still, instead of being pushed down and the links not being all visible when hovered over.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/logo-small-text.png" width="30%" alt="Logo on smallest screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On the who we are section there are two icons, used to give the reader some context, but not necessary on smaller screens where there is limited space as it is.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/who-we-are-icons.png" width="40%" alt="Who we are icons" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Here you can see the section on smaller screens (below width 600 pixels) doesn't show the icons.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/who-we-are-no-icons.png" width="40%" alt="Who we are section without icons" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The navbar unfortunately isn't functional on smaller screens, as the width simply isn't enough. To combat this we have the collapsible burger icon.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/burger.png" width="20%" alt="Burger icon" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

When clicked, the burger icon displays the same webpage anchor items but vertically instead.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/burger-pages.png" width="20%" alt="Burger icon clicked" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Here you can see the difference when the footer icons are displayed on a large screen ...

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/footer-big.png" width="80%" alt="Footer icons" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

... and on a smaller screen. The gap between is a percentage rather than an actual measurement, this means it's completely responsive.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/footer-med.png" width="60%" alt="Footer icons on small screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On the smallest screens, I've made the icons font size smaller, to stop them from displaying on a different line.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/footer-small.png" width="60%" alt="Footer icons smaller font size" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The progress bars on the "Benefits" page are automatically left center, meaning you can view the jogger in the background image.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/progress-big.png" width="75%" alt="Progress bars on big screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

But when made smaller, this changes to being fully centered. Note that the background image doesn't stay centered but instead moves with the right hand side of the screen, meaning on the smallest screens, the jogger is still visible.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/progress-med.png" width="40%" alt="Progress bars on small screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The progress. bars width is a percentage so changes with the width of the screen, and the height is larger when on smallest screens so that if the text goes onto the next line it is still within the bar.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/progress-small.png" width="30%" alt="Progress bar extra height" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

When the links within this section are clicked, it takes the user onto the source information's website.

The benefits section doesn't change too much between big and large screens, but the height is responsive and changes with the text wrapping.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/benefits-big.png" width="50%" alt="Benefits section on big screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

With the panic attack help section, the images either side disappear on smaller screens due to availability of space. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/panic-big.png" width="50%" alt="Panic section on small screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The height in this section is also responsive.

In the sessions section of the classes page, there are several changes through screen sizes. The most obvious one is the change of image from large screen to small.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sessions-big.png" width="40%" alt="Sessions section, large screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Note there are also differences in the grid format. It changes from 3x3 to 2x4.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sessions-med.png" width="20%" alt="Sessions section, medium screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On smallest screen sizes the header elements of the sessions have a smaller font size, so the divs aren't pushed too far wide of view.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sessions-small.png" width="20%" alt="Small header on session section" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The next section is even more complicated. On larger screens, I wanted the tutor image and information on the right whilst having the iframe element on the left.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/tutor-big.png" width="75%" alt="Tutor section, large screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The issue with this is when it is shown on a medium sized screen (between 600 -1000 pixels wide), the writing extends quite far and so the iframe is stretched, also the second tutor section has two images inside.

To fix this I have made the two images view vertically, and pushed the text onto the next line, using the grid-column-area commands.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/tutor-med.png" width="40%" alt="Tutor section medium screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On smallest screens, I've made it so each element displays vertically. All the information on all screen sizes is centered and the height properties change with the screen size.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/tutor-small.png" width="30%" alt="Tutor section, small screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

On the sign up page, there are only really two changes. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sign-big.png" width="40%" alt="Sign up page, big screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The input boxes have a width restriction on small screens so they don't outgrow their div, and the header text is made smaller. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sign-small.png" width="30%" alt="Sign up page, small screen" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The form also has required fields, with types on the inputs so that only the correct format can be entered.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sign-error-1.png" width="30%" alt="Incorrect data entered" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The form also wont allow information to not be submitted, as all fields have the required attribute.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sign-error-2.png" width="30%" alt="No data entered, but required" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - Some errors were found when going through the W3C validator. [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

  - There were two div closing tags that were not needed, one of them had to be swapped with a closing nav element.

  - The paragraph within the footer was in the unordered list, so I took it out and gve it its own styling.

  - There was a warning message that showed when the classes page went through. The validator didn't like that the tutor sections didn't have headings. I therefore changed the section elements to div elements here.

  - After these changes there are no more errors within all four pages of html.

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Fixed Bugs

This is a detailed log of the issues I ran into whilst coding my first project, and how I overcame them.

1). The first real issue I detected during the prototype stage. Everything looked great small but on a big screen the navbar and hero image wouldn't have even fit on the page due to size. I had my dimensions correct for everything to fit, but they took up every inch of space.

I fixed this by halving the height of the navbar and logo, and everything began to fit on the screen as it should. This is the difference of the two on my Figma prototype.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-1.png" width="80%" alt="Difference in navbar sizes" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

2). The next issue I ran into was the loading page hero image. The original size was over 5000 pixels in width and 3000 in height, I had to scale it down without losing any of the quality.

I did so by using this [Resizer](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/upload) to re-size the image, first at 75% its original size, this was too large, it also had gaps either side. I played with the sizes until i found that 69% was the best fit for the webpage.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-2-1.png" width="20%" alt="Hero image original size" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-2-2.png" width="20%" alt="Hero image improved size" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

3). I had issues when creating the navbar as the text inside the anchor elements were not being centered vertically, I fixed this by creating a span inside the anchor element for the text.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-3-1.png" width="20%" alt="Anchor, not vertically aligned" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-3-2.png" width="20%" alt="Anchor vertically aligned" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

4). Information on main page didn't seem enough for the page, also had issues with making it look central, with icons on the left but clear on the right.

I first made the text and icons bigger on desktop backgrounds and attempted to create some empty space on the page, adding to that calm feel we wanted. I created 3 columns within a row and gave the text the width of 6, I also added some bootstrap shortcut to get rid of the icons when the screen is phone sized, and gave the text some padding so it still sits within the section nicely.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-4-1.png" width="80%" alt="Small text, too much space" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-4-2.png" width="60%" alt="Finished homepage" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

5). I had an issue centering the cover text box on the landing page hero image. I had a bottom and right measurement, which on phone screens, was pushing it to the left and wasn't central.

I had to watch a few videos on flexbox and using it with bootstrap. I made the hero outer, which is the cover text's container, justify content centrally on small screen sizes. On larger screen sizes I made them position from the right, adding a right margin to the cover text box to push it away from the edge.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-5-1.png" width="50%" alt="Container not central" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-5-3.png" width="50%" alt="Container central" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

6). Footer social media links on smallest screen sizes were putting the very last social media link on the next line. My way of thinking was as it's only one link that is being pushed down, a simple media query that changes the font-size would suffice for screens at mobile size.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-6-1.png" width="30%" alt="Footer not contained" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-6-2.png" width="40%" alt="Code used" style="margin: 0 5%">

  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-6-3.png" width="40%" alt="Footer contained" style="margin: 0 5%;">
</div>

7). One of the hardest tasks I had was getting the elements on the classes page to move in 3 different ways for 3 different screen sizes. I deliberately chose quite tricky changes in my Figma prototype, to challenge myself. It took me a while to find something that helped, but I found this site very useful:

[Grid Layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_CSS_Grid_Layout)

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-7-1.png" width="40%" alt="Poor grid" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-7-2.png" width="40%" alt="Code used" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-7-3.png" width="40%" alt="Code used" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-7-4.png" width="40%" alt="Good layout" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

8). On smaller screen sizes, the background image of the index page is not centered, meaning that the woman in the image is only partly shown, and it's not easy to work out what the image is. I tried messing with the image's position property and adding a media guery margin-left to see if it pushed the image where I wanted it, neither worked. I'd noticed on other pages if I gave the image a cover position rather than a center one, it changes the images size in such a way that it fits the element it's in, but that didn't change the outcome either.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-8-1.png" width="30%" alt="Original image" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

I then thought about taking the original image and cropping out a percentage if the right hand side, then saving this as another image, and calling for it in a media query. I had to re-size the image afterwards but it did the trick, it calls when on a mobile device, and you can see that the woman is meditating now.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-8-2.png" width="30%" alt="Media queried image" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

9). The progress bar information looks terrible on the smallest screen sizes, with the link not wrapping inside the box it's in, and the boxes being of different width.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-9-1.png" width="30%" alt="Progress bar issues" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

Using Dev Tools I could see that there was a margin of 10px that was being added to all four sides, so I changed that to 10px 0, meaning there is no left or right margin, and the width was the same. I then made the URL an anchor element, with a link name that included the website name only, without all the extra URL info that was not necessary anymore, rather than wrapping the text for the user to have to scroll through. Lastly I changed the width of the overall container on small screen sizes.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-9-2.png" width="30%" alt="Progress bar fixed" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

10). The classes page is a mess on smallest screens. For some reason there is a scrollbar along the bottom that suggests that an element has a width that has not been set. I'm going to check every element on the page by setting the width to 100%, seeing if that fixes the issue, if not, then put it back to normal.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-10-1.png" width="20%" alt="Margin issue" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

After a lot of un-ticking of css properties in Dev Tools, I found that a margin-right property was being added to my .row divs. I searched for it in my CSS and I hadn't written it, it was being automatically set. I put margin-right: 0; for all my .row elements and the issue was resolved.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/bug-10-2.png" width="20%" alt="Code that resolved issue" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

### Content 

- I got the statistic I used for the first progress bar from this site:
[disturbmenot.co](https://disturbmenot.co/meditation-statistics/)
The site describes its source as "Project Meditation".

- I found the second statistic on this page:
[cogbtherapy.com](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-for-social-anxiety-disorder)
The page describes its source as "Eng, W., Roth, D.A., & Heimberg, R.G. (2001). Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy".

- The footer element throughout my site was inspired by the Love Running project, I liked the spacing and colour changing of the social links and it was easy to make it fit in with the project.

- The grid code was taken from [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_CSS_Grid_Layout) and I changed the fr and column values to get the finish I required.
